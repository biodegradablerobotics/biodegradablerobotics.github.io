    "    a. Explain, in words, how your team will evaluate the success of your robotâ€™s design. This could be by measuring the forces produced by your design, the speed at which it walks, its thrust:weight ratio, the height it can jump, etc. Explain, in words, how you will measure performance in simulation. How will you measure performance in experiments?\n",

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN>            When
searching for relevant references, we used keywords like: degradable,
biodegradable, disposable, sustainable, and composting robots.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN>            Article
[1] perfectly describes the motivation behind our research question and the
mindset that we want to approach possible applications and solutions with. The
article describes the wasteful practices of the tech industry and a recent push
for more sustainable practices which is particularly challenging in the field
of robotics. They propose a biodegradable robot that is fully functional but
degrades to nothing when left in the environment. The article explores
solutions including biodegradable sensors, actuators, and energy sources.
Finally, the article explains how a biodegradable would enable new methods and
applications that were not possible with conventional robots. We want to
consider all of the same things in our own investigation. We want to explore
more solutions to biodegradable sensors, actuators, and energy sources and to
identify applications where a biodegradable robot can match or even outperform
a conventional robot.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN>Article
[2] focuses on a disposable robotic finger design that can pick up unsanitary
objects. What makes this product unique is that it’s pneumatically driven,
using tubes and a commercially available cable chain to minimize costs for
disposal. The final product is able to implement a force of 4N at the
fingertips and conform to objects that range from a sheet of paper to a small,
30 gram box, while being completely disposable. The one thing about this
product is that the materials used, plastics and foam, are not biodegradable.
According to the research, switching to biodegradable materials is the next
step in the evolution of the pneumatic finger. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-top:12.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span lang=EN>Article [3] describes a “folded cellulose-substrate
microUnmanned Aerial Vehicle'' distinguishes itself from other UAVs by its
unique disposable attribute. The concept of a disposable UAV came with the
development of Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS), which are cheap
controllers. It is made up mostly of biodegradable material and is very small
and inexpensive to manufacture. The paper used is still very robust, having a
30 MPa tensile strength, and can still be creased to create joints for the
system. The UAV uses control surfaces along with its airfoil design to generate
enough lift for long range flight, with a large percentage of the aircraft’s mass
being contributed to the payload. This is feasible due to the small scale of
the UAV. The control is made possible using paper circuits, a cheaper and
lighter alternative to traditional wires. Trade offs include the fragility of
paper, limited size, susceptibility to water, as well as high impact of
variabilities that may occur during manufacture.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:12.0pt;text-align:justify;text-indent:
.5in'><span lang=EN>The design detailed in this report is a nearly entirely
bio-degradable UAV that only works in relatively clear skies. They created an
airborne, disposable robot, which could be improved upon, but does accomplish
most of the problem statement for its specific applications.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in'><span lang=EN>The
research [4] outlines the feasibility and use of small robotic sensors designed
to monitor and transmit data for atmospheric parameters. This is crucial for
their proposed idea, to create small robotic sensors that mimic raindrops when
deployed from a UAV. The paper researches in depth the motion, physics and
dynamics of a raindrop. It also does an in depth analysis on the required
electronics and design in order to mimic the research motion of raindrops. In
their conclusion they discuss the necessity for disposability and use of
biodegradable materials within these rain drop robots. The research
demonstrates the possibility that disposable robotics have a use and have
accomplished this theoretical work for our team. However, this paper only
addresses the feasibility of the raindrop robots, and does not fully accomplish
what our team hopes to achieve this semester.</span></p>

# **Dynamics II Plan**



**George**

Identify material

Acquire material

Construct prototype

Weigh each link, measure thickness - density


**Chris**

Design test stand

Design servo horns

Use density and SW - Mass and Inertia properties


**Lien**

Identify motor/servo

Motor mount (to test stand)


**Future**

Link stiffness

Joint stiffness

Joint damping

Actuator modeling

Input signal

Aerodynamics
